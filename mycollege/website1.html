            <p>"Education today has acquired a flavour and character thats never been before, with blurring of borders and overlapping of cultures, the world has shrunk to emerge as a single huge market place. Desperate consumers, heterogeneous work forces, converging technologies, information on the fly, market driven price structure, just-in-time supply chain managements etc., the scenario is exciting, dynamic and challenging."</p>
            <p>The need of the hour therefore, is creation of competencies through capabilities. CMS envisages to do just that, drawing strengths from its unparalleled resource of academic experiences, world class state of the art infrastructure, high caliber faculty, industry interface and above all commitment to excellence in education. I will appreciate to become part of our ongoing mission to transform passions into careers.</p>
